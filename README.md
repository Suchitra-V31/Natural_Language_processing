# Natural_Language_processing
Natural Language Processing(NLP) is defined as the branch of Artificial Intelligence that provides computers with the capability of understanding text and spoken words in the same way a human being can.

In any Machine learning task, cleaning or preprocessing the data is as important as model building. Text data is one of the most unstructured forms of available data and when comes to deal with Human language then itâ€™s too complex. 

**Text Preprocessing Techniques**

1.Expand Contractions

2.Lower Case

3.Remove Punctuations

4.Remove words and digits containing digits

5.Remove Stopwords

6.Rephrase Text

7.Stemming and Lemmatization

8.Remove White spaces

In this repository we will walk through some interesting projects which we will be accomplished by using NLP techniques and we could infer various insights from it.
